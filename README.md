## Part of tutorial

These repositories will be cloned and installed during the tutorial

1. [RIF Marketplace Developer Environment](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-dev/) project
1. **(Disabled)** [RIF Comms Pubsub BootNode](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-communications-pubsub-bootnode) project
1. [RIF Marketplace Cache](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache/) project
1. [RIF Marketplace Upload Service](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-upload-service/) project
1. [RIF Storage Pinning Service](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-storage-pinner/) project
1. [RIF Marketplace UI](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui/) project
1. [RNS Manager Project](https://github.com/rnsdomains/rns-manager-react)
1. [RIF Notifier Service](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-notifier) project

## Quick Start

1. `meta git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-dev.git` - will clone the meta dev repository and recursively clone the nested ones. In case you cloned the repo with the standard git command, simply execute - `meta git update` inside of the repo.
2. Go to the cloned folder (`cd rif-marketplace-dev`) and execute `npm run all` or `npm run mkp`

   - `npm run all` - will install all the dependencies, configure project with default options for the local setup, and start services and applications via `pm2` manager.
     _Note_: This command will also install [Java 11](https://www.java.com/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [MySQL 8](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) during notifier installation phasse, if they are not already installed.
   - `npm run mkp` - will do the same, but only for the contracts, cache and dapp.

3. Use `pm2` to see the list of running processes (`pm2 list`), logs(`pm2 logs <id|name>`), etc.
   You should see the result similar to this one
   ![pm2-list](/assets/images/pm2-list.png)

If desired, use `pm2 stop all` to stop all the processes.

`meta` tool provides a convenient interface to work with multiple repositories simultaneously. There are different plugins for bulk operations, including `git` and `npm`. Some examples are:

- `meta git status`, `meta git status --include-only dir1,dir2`
- `meta git update`
- `meta git -b checkout branch-name`
- `meta npm install`
- `meta exec "<any-command>"`

Please refer to the documentation for more details.

## Detailed Setup

## 1. Developers Environment

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Developer Environment

```sh
meta git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-dev.git

cd rif-marketplace-dev
```

### 1.1. Starting local blockchain

Now you can start local blockchain in terminal, pm2 or docker with

```sh
npm run ganache-cli or npm run ganache-cli:mining or npm run ganache-cli:pm2
```

Docker

```sh
docker-compose up
```

The Ganache blockchain will now run and it is available to deploy the corresponding Smart Contracts.

### 1.2. Deploying smart contracts

To deploy all the contracts and start a local blockchain in pm2, execute

```sh
npm run contracts:config
```

To only deploy the contracts:

```sh
npm run contracts:deploy
```

To re-deploy the contracts:

```sh
npm run contracts:redeploy
```

If you want to deploy to other chain than local, use an appropriate script: `npm run contracts:*`. For more detailed setup refer to the contracts folders.

The `contracts:create-config` will generate the files below and copy the contract addresses to all other repositories.

- `ui-config.json` - the configuration file for the [RIF Marketplace UI](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui). This contains information for all the networks which are deployed. This should be put in the `rif-marketplace-ui/src/ui-config.json`.
- `cache-[network]-config.json` - Specific per network configuration file for the [RIF Marketplace Cache](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache) service. The configuration should be in `rif-marketplace-cache/config/local.json`.
- `rnsAdmin-[network]-config.json` - Per network conguration file for the [RNS Domains Manager](https://github.com/rnsdomains/rns-manager-react). The configuration should be in `rns-manager-react/src/config/contracts.local.json`.
- `rooms-[network].json` - Rooms attribute for the [RIF Communications Pubsub Bootnode](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-communications-pubsub-bootnode) configuration file.

**Attention: the scripts automatically copy addresses to all repo folders. Don't push those files if you re-deployed locally with different addresses or if you deployed to a non-local chain as a non-release process.**

### 1.3. Browser wallet

In MetaMask or Nifty import the first address from `keys.txt` file. The private key is `0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d`

Connect to the local ganache network (Localhost 8545 in the network dropdown). You should now see a balance of 99 ETH (or close to that - some gas was already used to deploy the Contracts)

Now we will add RIF token. Click on `Add Token` -> `Custom Token` and input the token address that is in `./out/ui-config.json` under the `rif` attribute (should be `0x67B5656d60a809915323Bf2C40A8bEF15A152e3e` if this is your first deployment). You should now see your RIF tokens balance of 997 RIF.

You can similarly add more accounts to your wallet if needed.

### 1.4. IPFS Nodes

For this setup you will need at least two running instances of **IPFS**. These can be spawned and ran easily through the **RIF Storage Pinning** repository, which will provide two instances already configured and ready to be used by the **RIF Marketplace**.

> The nodes are automatically started via the main setup. If you want to run them in the terminal or with pm2 on your own, execute the commands `npm run pinner:ipfs:*` from the `package.json`. For the detailed setup, please refer to the pinner repository.

Download and setup the Pinning service

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-storage-pinner.git
cd rif-storage-pinner
npm ci
```

Initialize development repos that are placed in `.repos`. This folder can be anytime removed and the `init` command rerun. All data will be purged though.

```sh
npm run init
```

Spawn IPFS daemons

```sh
npm run ipfs:consumer daemon
npm run ipfs:provider daemon
```

You can use NPM's scripts `npm run ipfs:consumer` and `npm run ipfs:provider` to interact with each IPFS node. These take the same arguments as the `ipfs` command.

You should now have two instances of **IPFS** running on ports `5002` and `5003`.

## 2. RIF Communications Pubsub Bootnode

**Temprarily disabled and not downloaded. libp2p communication has been potsponed. Skip this paragraph.**

Download and setup the RIF Communications Pubsub Bootnode

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-communications-pubsub-bootnode.git

cd rif-communications-pubsub-bootnode
```

Install the dependencies

```sh
npm ci
```

Copy the `rooms` attribute from the configuration file generated in step [1.2](#1.2.Deploying-smart-contracts) from `rif-marketplace-dev/out/rooms-ganache.json`. Include this attribute in the `development.json5` file. It should look like:

```json
{
  peerId: { ... },
  rooms: [ "8545:0xddb64fe46a91d46ee29420539fc25fd07c5fea3e:0x90F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1",
           "8545:0xddb64fe46a91d46ee29420539fc25fd07c5fea3e:0xFFcf8FDEE72ac11b5c542428B35EEF5769C409f0",
           "8545:0xddb64fe46a91d46ee29420539fc25fd07c5fea3e:0x22d491Bde2303f2f43325b2108D26f1eAbA1e32b",
           "8545:0xddb64fe46a91d46ee29420539fc25fd07c5fea3e:0xE11BA2b4D45Eaed5996Cd0823791E0C93114882d" ]
}
```

Run the Pubsub Bootnode with

```sh
NODE_ENV=development npm run start
```

## 3. RIF Marketplace Cache

> Cache is automatically started via the main setup. If you want to run them in the terminal, execute `npm run cache` or with pm2 `npm run cache:start:pm2`. Other basic commands are available under `npm run cache:*`. For the detailed setup, please refer to the cache repository.

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Cache

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-cache.git

cd rif-marketplace-cache
```

```sh
npm run bin -- db-migration --up
```

Run Precache process for the RNS Service (for ganache network)

```sh
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin precache rns storage
```

Run the cache for the RNS Service with

```sh
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin -- start --enable rns storage --log=debug
```

## 4. RIF Marketplace Upload Service

> Upload Service is automatically started via the main setup. If you want to run them in the terminal, execute `npm run upload-service` or with pm2 `npm run upload-service:start:pm2`. Other basic commands are available under `npm run upload-service:*`. For the detailed setup, please refer to the repository.

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace Upload Service

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-upload-service.git

```

Create the DB using the following command:

```sh
npm run bin -- db-migration --up
```

Run Upload Service (connected to previously deployed IPFS node)

```sh
NODE_ENV=development npm run bin start -- --log=debug
```

## 5. RIF Marketplace UI

> UI is automatically started via the main setup. If you want to run them in the terminal, execute `npm run dapp` or with pm2 `npm run dapp:start:pm2`. For the detailed setup, please refer to the repository.

Download and setup the RIF Marketplace UI

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-marketplace-ui.git

cd rif-marketplace-ui
```

Install the dependencies

```sh

```

Run the UI (Will be available on `http://localhost:3000/`)

```sh
npm start
```

## 6. RNS Manager

> RNS Manager is automatically started via the main setup. If you want to run them in the terminal, execute `npm run rns-manager` or with pm2 `npm run rns-manager:start:pm2`. For the detailed setup, please refer to the repository.

Download and setup the RNS Manager

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rnsdomains/rns-manager-react.git

cd rns-manager-react
```

Install the dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

Copy the configuration file generated in step [1.2](#1.2.Deploying-smart-contracts) from `rif-marketplace-dev/out/rnsAdmin-ganache-config.json` into `rns-manager-react/src/config/contracts.local.json`.

Now you can start the UI (You may need to switch to another port such as `http://localhost:3001` if you are already running the RIF Marketplace UI)

```sh
npm start
```

## 7. RIF Storage Pinning service

> This is a service that listens on blockchain events and when new Agreement is created it pins a file to the configured IPFS node.
> Pinner Service is automatically started via the main setup. If you want to run it in the terminal, execute `npm run pinner` or with pm2 `npm run pinner:start:pm2`. Other basic commands are available under `npm run pinner:*`. For the detailed setup, please refer to the repository.

Download and setup the Pinning service (already done when running **IPFS** nodes)

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-storage-pinner.git
cd rif-storage-pinner
npm ci
```

Make sure you have **IPFS** installed. We will use one of the previously deployed instances of **IPFS**.

To interact with pinning service use the `npm run bin` script. To start Pinning service run:

```sh
npm run bin -- init --offerId={your_account} --db=./db.sqlite
```

This will provide the `peerId` that should be used in the _RIF Marketplace UI_ to create the Storage offer. You can create the offer on `http://localhost:3000/storage/sell?peerId={your_peer_id}`.

Once the offer is created in the UI you can run the service using:

```sh
NODE_ENV=ganache npm run bin daemon -- --log=debug --db=./db.sqlite
```

You should see in logs when new Agreements are detected and pinned.

## 8. RIF Notifier service

RIF Notifier is a service that listens to events on the blockchain and notifies its users of the blockchain events using one of the supported notification methods (API/SMS/EMAIL)

RIF Notifier is automatically started via the main setup. If you want to run it in the terminal, execute `npm run notifier` or with pm2 `npm run notifer:start:pm2`. Other basic commands are available under `npm run notifer:*`. For the detailed setup, please refer to the repository.

Download and setup the rif-notifier service

```sh
git clone git@github.com:rsksmart/rif-notifier.git
cd rif-notifier
```

1. To install java, maven and mysql for first time run the script, and input password values when prompted for mysql. If you have already installed mysql, skip to step 3.

   ```sh
   bin/meta-install.sh
   ```

2. To secure the mysql installation for first time, run the script

   ```sh
   bin/mysqlunattended.sh
   ```

3. For existing mysql installation, use the script to create notifier_user

   ```sh
   bin/install.sh
   ```

4. Install notifier-prov-cli using the steps [here](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-notifier/tree/master/notifier-prov-cli)

5. To configure rif-notifier with other required parameters, see the help for command below. (Ensure all the required parameters are set. For sample configuration see `config/config-ganache.json`)

   ```sh
   notifier-prov-cli configure --help
   ```

6. To start rif-notifier

   ```sh
   notifier-prov-cli start
   ```

In case of permission issues, run using `sudo`

For more information about usage of rif-notifier see [its repository](https://github.com/rsksmart/rif-notifier)

**See help pages for details on the parameters and additional commands!!!**

## Using the RIF Marketplace

### Registering domains using RNS

Go through the normal RNS registration flow but each time you make transaction you need to create new block as it requires at least 1 confirmation. You can do that with:

```sh
sh forward.sh
```

Alternatively, you can start a mining local blockchain with the command `npm run ganache-cli:mining`. It will mine a block every 15 seconds.

## Dev Envirionment

### Contracts Methods Execution, Access to dRBTC

The devnet contracts are owned by the wallet of rskj clinet running on the cache dev infrastructure node.

To pefrorm any operations like deployment, contracts call:

1. Start a script from the root of the rif-marketplace-dev: `./proxy-dev-node.sh`
2. Connect to the node from any contract folder (rns-dev, storage-dev, notifier-dev) with `npx truffle --network rskdevnet`

If you want to receive the full list of accounts without truffle connection, execute:

```sh
curl http://localhost:4444 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_accounts","params":[],"id":1}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### RNS manager missmatch between networks

Solution: switch back and forth a network on MetaMask/Nifty. If that does not work make sure you have setup correctly the network id in the RNS step.

If you encounter more issues, please refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://hackmd.io/@rsk-infra-protocols/HJeABR-T_)
